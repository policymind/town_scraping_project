## ecode360

Update: found that ecode has a link that renders the entire doc as HTML.
`https://ecode360.com/BE3086` becomes
`https://ecode360.com/output/word_html/BE3086`

Will be able to use `beautifulsoup4` and `markdownify` for this step.


---------------------------------------

ecode360 is interesting. `class="titleChevronLink"` will be your best friend. Do we store each section as html? OR is the best way to save it in json format to keep all the great `div class` information and retain the structure.
What's the best way to structure that json? by chapter?
